Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body; the latter process is referred to as metastasis. Metastases are the primary cause of death from cancer. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide.Cancer is a genetic disease as it is caused by mutations or changes to genes that control the way our cells function, causing them to behave irregularly, especially how they grow and divide.

Carcinomas. A carcinoma begins in the skin or the tissue that covers the surface of internal organs and glands.Examples of carcinomas include prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.
Sarcomas. A sarcoma begins in the tissues that support and connect the body. A sarcoma can develop in fat, muscles, nerves, tendons, joints, blood vessels, lymph vessels, cartilage, or bone.
Leukemias. Leukemia is a cancer of the blood. Leukemia begins when healthy blood cells change and grow uncontrollably. The 4 main types of leukemia are acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia.

Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body; the latter process is referred to as metastasis. Metastases are the primary cause of death from cancer. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide.Cancer is a genetic disease as it is caused by mutations or changes to genes that control the way our cells function, causing them to behave irregularly, especially how they grow and divide.<br>

## Types of cancers—

Doctors divide cancer into types based on where it begins. Four main types of cancer are:

Carcinomas. A carcinoma begins in the skin or the tissue that covers the surface of internal organs and glands.Examples of carcinomas include prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.
Sarcomas. A sarcoma begins in the tissues that support and connect the body. A sarcoma can develop in fat, muscles, nerves, tendons, joints, blood vessels, lymph vessels, cartilage, or bone.
Leukemias. Leukemia is a cancer of the blood. Leukemia begins when healthy blood cells change and grow uncontrollably. The 4 main types of leukemia are acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia.
Lymphomas. Lymphoma is a cancer that begins in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and glands that help fight infection. There are 2 main types of lymphomas: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Breast to women are very very special, so anything related to it, is absolutely serious (atleast for them). Due to predefined “structural” image of a women in our society, it had became so hard for women to accept themselves as a “complete women" without two breast. As women, they have to go through all this and might even feel somewhat like it. Breast cancer is a world wide known brutal disease about which everyone knows, but not upto the required extend. It’s the most common cancer in women, although it can also develop in men but its rare. Several organisations, people, committees etc try to spread as much information as they can. This is just for spreading awareness among the women, as she is just not only an individual but a very importent part of one’s family. No one would want their loved ones to suffer in front of them, specially when that loved one is your mother, spouse, daughter or sister.

## Female Breast:

The breast is made up of different tissue, ranging from very fatty tissue to very dense tissue. Within this tissue is a network of lobes. Each lobe is made up of tiny, tube-like structures called lobules that contain milk glands. Tiny ducts connect the glands, lobules, and lobes, carrying milk from the lobes to the nipple. The nipple is located in the middle of the areola, which is the darker area that surrounds the nipple.Blood and lymph vessels also run throughout the breast. Blood nourishes the cells. The lymph system drains bodily waste products.

## Breast Cancer:

Breast cancer starts when cells in the breast begin to divide and grow in an abnormal way, which creates a mass of tissue called a tumor. If the cells that are growing out of control are normal cells, the tumor is called benign (non cancerous). If, however, the cells that are growing out of control are abnormal and don’t function like the body’s normal cells, the tumor is called malignant (cancerous), meaning it can grow and spread to other parts of the body. A benign tumor means the tumor can grow but will not spread.

Breast cancer spreads when the cancer grows into adjacent organs or other parts of the body or when breast cancer cells move to other parts of the body through the blood vessels and/or lymph vessels. This is called a metastasis. Although breast cancer most commonly spreads to nearby lymph nodes, it can also spread further through the body to areas such as the bones, lungs, liver, and brain etc.

## Types of Breast Cancer —

Breast cancer can be invasive or non-invasive. Invasive breast cancer is cancer that spreads into surrounding tissues and/or distant organs. Non-invasive breast cancer does not go beyond the milk ducts or lobules in the breast.

1. ### Ductal carcinoma — These cancers start in the cells lining the milk ducts and make up the majority of breast cancers.
   * Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) — This is a non-invasive cancer that is located only in the duct and has not spread outside the duct.
   * Invasive or infiltrating ductal carcinoma — This is cancer that has spread outside of the duct.
2. ### Invasive lobular carcinoma — This is cancer that started in the lobules and has spread outside of the lobules.

Less common types of breast cancer include:

1. Medullary
2. Mucinous
3. Tubular
4. Metaplastic
5. Papillary
6. Inflammatory breast cancer — It is an aggressive type of cancer that accounts for about 1% to 5% of all breast cancers.
7. Paget’s disease is a type of cancer that begins in the ducts of the nipple. Although it is usually non-invasive, it can also be an invasive cancer.

## Risk factors :
Breast cancer is not a transmissible or infectious disease.The following factors may raise a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer:

1. Age , The risk of developing breast cancer increases as a woman ages, with most cancers developing in women older than 50.
2. Personal history of breast cancer. A woman who has had breast cancer in 1 breast has a higher risk of developing a new cancer in either breast.
3. Family history of breast cancer. Breast cancer may run in the family too.
4. Early menstruation and late menopause. Women who began menstruating before ages 11 or 12 or went through menopause after age 55 have a somewhat higher risk of breast cancer.
5. Radiation exposure at a young age. Exposure to ionizing radiation at a young age may increase a woman’s risk of breast cancer.
6. Various Lifestyle factors like tobacco and alcohol may contribute to the development of breast cancer.

Behavioural choices and related interventions that reduce the risk of breast cancer include:

1. prolonged breastfeeding
2. regular physical activity, weight control
3. avoidance of harmful use of alcohol
4. avoidance of exposure to tobacco, smoke
5. avoidance of prolonged use of hormones
6. avoidance of excessive radiation exposure.

Unfortunately, even if all of the potentially modifiable risk factors could be controlled, this would only reduce the risk of developing breast cancer by at most 30%.

## Warning signs and symptoms :

The majority of women with breast cancer do not have any body changes (signs) or symptoms when they are first diagnosed with breast cancer.

The following signs and symptoms should be discussed with a doctor.

1. A lump that feels like a hard knot or a thickening in the breast or under the arm. It is important to feel the same area in the other breast to make sure the change is not a part of healthy breast tissue in that area.
2. Change in the size or shape of the breast.
3. Nipple discharge that occurs suddenly, is bloody, or occurs in only 1 breast.
4. Physical changes, such as a nipple turned inward or a sore located in the nipple area.
5. Skin irritation or changes, such as puckering, dimpling, scaliness, or new creases.
6. A warm, red, swollen breast with or without a rash with dimpling resembling the skin of an orange, called “peau d'orange”.
7. Pain in the breast, particularly breast pain that does not go away. Pain is not usually a symptom of breast cancer, but it should be reported to a doctor.

If cancer is diagnosed, relieving symptoms is an important part of cancer care and treatment. This may be called palliative care or supportive care. Be sure to talk with your health care team about the symptoms you experience.

## Breast Cancer Diagnosis :

Doctors use many tests to find, or diagnose, breast cancer. They may also do tests to learn if the cancer has spread to a part of the body other than the breast and the lymph nodes under the arm. Doctors may also do tests to learn which treatments could work best.

The following tests may be used to diagnose breast cancer or for follow-up testing after a breast cancer diagnosis.

1. Diagnostic mammography — It is similar to screening mammography except that more pictures of the breast are taken. It is often used when a woman is experiencing signs, such as a new lump or nipple discharge. Diagnostic mammography may also be used if something suspicious is found on a screening mammogram.
2. Ultrasound — An ultrasound can distinguish between a solid mass, which may be cancer, and a fluid-filled cyst, which is usually not cancer.
3. MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging) — A MRI is more sensitive than a mammogram and an ultrasound in picking up lumps or abnormal areas in the breast.
4. Biopsy — A biopsy is the removal of a small amount of tissue for examination under a microscope. Other tests can suggest that cancer is present, but only a biopsy can make a definite diagnosis.There are three types of biopsies:
   1. Fine-needle aspiration
   2. Core-needle biopsy
   3. Surgical biopsy
      
## Stages :

Staging is a way of describing that how extensive the breast cancer is. Staging can be done either before or after a patient undergoes surgery. Knowing the stage helps the doctor to decide what kind of treatment is best and can help predict a patient’s prognosis, which is the chance of recovery.

TNM System Of Staging 
The most widely used method of staging breast cancer is the TNM system

TNM stands for:

T = Tumor size (How large is the primary tumor in the breast? What are its biomarkers?)<br>
N = Lymph node status (the number and location of lymph nodes with cancer)<br>
M = Metastases (whether or not the cancer has spread to other areas of the body)

## Treatment :
In the past, all breast cancers were treated surgically by mastectomy (complete removal of the breast), but now time has changed. The biology and behavior of breast cancer affects the treatment plan. Some tumors are smaller but grow quickly, while others are larger and grow slowly. Treatment options and recommendations are very personalized and depend on several factors :

* The size of the tumor in relation to the size of your breast
* The results of specific pathology tests (hormone receptors, HER2 receptors, grade of the cells, proliferation rate of the cells)
* Whether you have gone through menopause
* Your general health
* Your age
* Your family history or other risk factors associated with a predisposition for developing breast or ovarian cancer

## Surgery :
Surgery is the removal of the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue during an operation.The goal of surgery is to remove not only the tumor, but also enough of the margin to be able to test for the spread of the cancer. Once the removed tissue is checked, your post-operative report should tell you if you had “clear margins,” (meaning the tissue farthest away from the breast was free of any cancer cells). The types of surgery for breast cancer include the following:

### Lumpectomy
A lumpectomy usually removes the least amount of breast tissue. The surgeon removes the cancer and a small portion or margin of the surrounding tissue, but not the breast itself.

### Mastectomy
In the past, breast cancer surgery often required removing the entire breast, chest wall, and all axillary lymph nodes in a procedure called a radical mastectomy. While radical mastectomies are less common today.

## Chemotherapy :
Chemotherapy is a treatment method that uses a combination of drugs to either destroy cancer cells or slow down the growth of cancer cells. Although chemotherapy kills the fast-growing cancer cells, the drugs can also unfortunately harm normal cells that divide rapidly. Chemotherapy’s side effects can include fatigue, risk of infection, nausea and vomiting, hair loss, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, numbness and tingling, pain, early menopause, weight gain, and chemo-brain or cognitive dysfunction. These side effects can often be very successfully prevented or managed during treatment with supportive medications, and they usually go away after treatment is finished.

## Radiation therapy :
Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy x-rays or other particles to destroy cancer cells. There are several different types of radiation therapy:

* External-beam radiation therapy
This is the most common type of radiation treatment and is given from a machine outside the body
* Intra-operative radiation therapy
This is when radiation treatment is given using a probe in the operating room.
* Brachytherapy
This type of radiation therapy is given by placing radioactive sources into the tumor.

Radiation therapy can have side effects, and these vary from person to person. The most common side-effects are:

* Sunburn-type skin irritation of the targeted area (which may range from mild to intense)
* Red, dry, tender, or itchy skin
* Breast heaviness
* Discoloration, redness, or a bruised appearance
* General fatigue

## Hormonal therapy :
Hormonal therapy, also called endocrine therapy, is an effective treatment for most tumors that test positive for either estrogen or progesterone receptors. This type of tumor uses hormones to fuel its growth. Blocking the hormones can help prevent a cancer recurrence and death from breast cancer when hormonal therapy is used either by itself or after chemotherapy. Hormonal therapies used in breast cancer treatment act as “anti-hormone” or “anti-estrogen” therapies. They block hormone actions or lower hormone levels in the body. Hormonal therapy may also be called endocrine therapy. The endocrine system in the body makes hormones.

## Targeted therapy :
Targeted therapy is a treatment that targets the cancer’s specific genes, proteins, or the tissue environment that contributes to cancer growth and survival. These treatments are very focused and work differently than chemotherapy. This type of treatment blocks the growth and spread of cancer cells and limits damage to healthy cells.

## Immunotherapy :
Immunotherapy, also called biologic therapy, is designed to boost the body’s natural defenses to fight the cancer. It uses materials made either by the body or in a laboratory to improve, target, or restore immune system function.

The effectiveness of breast cancer therapies depends on the full course of treatment. Partial treatment is less likely to lead to a positive outcome.

## Challenges :
Breast Cancer is painful just not because it’s a disease, but also because it brings a lot of challenges with it. Breast cancer survivors are found to have multiple physical, psychological and social problems. Like in the treatment of any other hazardous disease, “Finance” is a big challenge in breast cancer treatments too. People need financial stability to get access to a treatment centre with an oncologist in order to receive treatment. Since it’s a disease related to breast, many people feel uncomfortable discussing the topic of breast cancer. Due to the shamefulness associated with
women’s health and the sexual association of breast, many women and men are embarrassed to discuss the topic. The most effective way of overcoming this challenge is, educating both men and women on breast cancer through the use of community workers.
